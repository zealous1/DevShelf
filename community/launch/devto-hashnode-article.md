# We Audited 530+ Developer Tools to Find Every Secret Free Tier (And Built a Zero-Paywall Directory)

If you have tried signing up for a new developer tool recently, you have probably experienced this sequence:

1. Land on a shiny marketing page promising **"Free Forever"**.
2. Click **"Get Started"**.
3. Meet an aggressive modal: *"Enter credit card to begin 14-day trial (you will be billed $49/mo after)"*.
4. Close the tab in frustration.

Over the past decade, the developer software landscape has undergone a silent transformation. What used to be genuine free tiers designed to nurture grass-roots adoption have increasingly morphed into **trial traps**, **freemium bait**, and **vendor lock-in funnels**.

Frustrated by this trend, our open-source team spent the last several months auditing over **566 developer tools, public APIs, AI agents, and cloud platforms**. 

We set out to answer one question:  
*Can a developer still build, test, and ship production-grade software on a true $0 budget without entering a credit card?*

The answer is **yes** — but you need to know where to look.

To solve this permanently, we built and open-sourced **[DevShelf](https://devshelf.ritualdev.in)**: a zero-paywall developer ecosystem with continuous automated health checks, a terminal CLI, and a native Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

Here is what we learned from auditing 566+ tools, along with the most valuable zero-paywall discoveries you can use today.

## 🏛️ The 5 Golden Rules of a "Zero-Paywall" Tool

Before adding any resource to DevShelf, it must pass five strict criteria:

1. **No Upfront Credit Card Required:** If a tool asks for payment details before granting access to its sandbox or core features, it is disqualified.
2. **Permanent Free Tier (No 14-Day Traps):** The free allowance must be sustainable indefinitely (e.g. 500MB DB storage, 10,000 monthly API calls, or self-hosted open-source).
3. **No Artificial Hostage Gates:** Essential functionality like exporting data, CORS headers, or reading logs cannot be locked behind enterprise paywalls.
4. **Verified Uptime & Active Maintenance:** If the repository has been archived or the HTTP endpoint returns 5xx/404 errors, it is sunsetted by our CI.
5. **Permissive Open-Source or Generous Indie Tier:** Tools that foster community and self-hosting are prioritized.

## 💎 The Top Zero-Paywall Discoveries by Category

### 1. AI Agents & Local LLMs (99 Tools)
Running LLMs in production can quickly run up thousands of dollars in token bills. These open-source tools let you develop and run AI locally with zero API costs:

- **[Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)**: The gold standard for running Llama 3.3, Mistral, and Qwen locally on macOS, Linux, and Windows with a single command.
- **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)**: High-throughput, memory-efficient serving engine for LLMs with PagedAttention.
- **[AgentShield](https://github.com/RitualDev-Lab/AgentShield)**: Zero-leak secret interception, entropy tokenization, and command sandboxing for Claude Code and Cursor agents.
- **[LocalAI](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI)**: Drop-in REST API replacement for OpenAI that runs completely offline on consumer CPU hardware.

### 2. Free Public APIs (108 Endpoints)
Need real data for your prototype without wading through 10-step enterprise API key approvals?
- **Public APIs without Auth**: Weather, exchange rates, geocoding, and mock banking endpoints that return instant JSON without registration.
- **CORS-Friendly**: All tested directly from browser `fetch()` without blocking security headers.

### 3. Testing, Mocking & QA (66 Tools)
- **[LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)**: Fully functional local AWS cloud stack. Develop your S3, SQS, DynamoDB, and Lambda apps entirely on your laptop.
- **[Mockoon](https://mockoon.com)**: The easiest way to design and run mock REST APIs locally in seconds.
- **[WireMock](https://wiremock.org)**: Battle-tested API mocking with stateful behavior and fault injection.

### 4. Free Cloud & Database Tiers (72 Platforms)
- **[Neon](https://neon.tech)**: Serverless Postgres with instant branching and generous free storage.
- **[Turso](https://turso.tech)**: Edge-replicated SQLite powered by LibSQL.
- **[PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io)**: 1-file backend with embedded SQLite, realtime subscriptions, and auth.
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com)**: Open-source Firebase alternative with Postgres, Edge Functions, and Vector search.

## 🤖 Built for Developers: CLI and Native MCP Server

We know developers dislike leaving their code editor. That's why DevShelf was built with two first-class developer interfaces:

### 1. Terminal CLI (`npx devshelf`)
Search the directory or get a random recommendation directly from your shell:

```bash
# Search by keyword
npx devshelf search "vector database"

# Get a random verified tool for weekend inspiration
npx devshelf random

# View category statistics
npx devshelf stats
```

### 2. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server
If you use **Claude Desktop**, **Cursor**, or **Windsurf**, you can connect DevShelf directly to your AI pair programmer. Add this to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "devshelf": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@ritualdev-lab/devshelf@latest", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now, you can ask your AI:
> *"Find me a free, CORS-friendly geocoding API with no credit card required."*

And your AI will query DevShelf's live index to return exact documentation and code snippets!
